If you have an issue or suggestion for the API, visit <a href="https://github.com/EVE-KILL/projectRena/issues" target="_blank">https://github.com/EVE-KILL/projectRena/issues</a>

Otherwise, please be respectful of the API, if you hammer it or misuse it, you will get blocked from it.

## Authorization Tokens
Currently they're a bit cumbersome to get, because there is no UI on the frontpage.

So a way around it is to login on <a href="https://evedata.xyz">https://evedata.xyz</a> and then looking at the headers. (Not exactly secure, but the token doesn't give access to much of note yet)
